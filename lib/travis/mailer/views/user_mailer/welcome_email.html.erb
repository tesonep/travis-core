  <h3>Welcome to Travis CI!</h3>

  <p>
    Hey <%= @user.name.blank? ? @user.login : @user.name %>,
  </p>

  <p>
    We'd like to extend a warm welcome to you and provide with some links to help you get started.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you haven't set up your first project yet, head to <a href="https://<%= Travis.config.host %>/profile">your
      accounts page</a> and enable the project you'd like to test on Travis CI. Push some code, and your repository
    will appear on <a href="https://<%= Travis.config.host %>"><%= Travis.config.host -%></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Are you part of an organization that's already running builds on Travis CI? Great news, we've just finished
    synchronizing your permissions from GitHub. You can see the projects you have access to and that have already
    been built on Travis CI at <a href="https://<%= Travis.config.host %>"><%= Travis.config.host %></a> so you can
    dive in right away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember to add a .travis.yml file to your project to tell us what steps we should execute to set up your build
    environment and run your build. We have sensible defaults, but you're free to customize everything to your
    liking.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can find all details on how to <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com">setup specific languages</a>, the
    available <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/">configuration options</a> for your
    builds, and our <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/">build environment in <a
        href="http://docs.travis-ci.com">our documentation</a>. Don't forget to setup <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/">notifications</a> if
      you'd like to be kept up-to-date about your builds on <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Campfire-notification">Campfire</a>, <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#HipChat-notification">HipChat</a>, <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#IRC-notification">IRC</a>, and others.

  <p>
    Have an awesome day!
